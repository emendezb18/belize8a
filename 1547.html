    In 1525,the Spanish colony, after knowing that Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, discovered Yucatán. Francisco de Montejo his son, the advanced,went with his Spanish army to Cozumel Island.Cozumel was a place which was located east Mexico and North East Belize.<br><br> Francisco de Montejo needed to conquist the Yucatán Peninsula because the Spanish people wanted Latin territory and to follow his father steps when he colonized Guatemala.Francisco and his army were well received and in a respectful way. The Mayas were tired of their requirements and with an epidemic the Spanish brought to Yucatán, the Mayas challenged the Spanish so Francisco was 100% sure to conquer Yucatan.<br><br>
    
    In 1930 to 1931 the Spanish invaded the Occidental of the Peninsula but first created the Salamanca Xicalango. While invading, another epidemic affected his army,so 20% of his group stayed in Salamanca. So Alonso de Davila commanded Salamanca.<br><br> For 5 years Francisco planned how to enter Yucatán and conquer it. So 1538 Francisco finally conquered half of Yucatan while the other half the Mayas were ripping off the weapons,uniforms etc of the Spanish army to use against them.
    This event is important for Belize history because it shows how Belize’s land started to be a problem because many people wanted to have that territory and the Yucatán.
