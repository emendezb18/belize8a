<p>Belize,since 1862 was commanded by British Honduras by territory,by rights and by power. Until 1972 that the colonized citizens changed their name to the actual name:Belize. In 1976 the governor of Belize Eugenio Garc√≠a (from Guatemala) ordered the military around Belize with the frontiers of Honduras to not exit the country.<br><br> Hours later the worst earthquake Belize had suffered,so he retracted the military forces. For 5 years Belize was very neutral and quiet with all the opinions citizens made of complete independence from British Honduras.
