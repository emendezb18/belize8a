<p>In 1862 British Honduras ( a British colony with lower power) found a place that could help them to feel bigger and have more power. There had been a Spanish colony since the 16 century, but they were in discussion with British Honduras for land,but Spanish groups got some rights of territory or visiting the territory. 

    In Belize (In 1900,s) citizens were very stressed with the British Honduras because in 1800 the Maya’s and the British Honduras were improving economically,importing and exporting many rare resources to the British Honduras.<br><br> In 1920 the Great Depression started in the USA. That means there was a very big loss of money,food,and agriculture. In 1930 it came to British Honduras the Great Depression. They didn’t know how to manage that situation, so they started to lose a large amount of wood and gatherers out of work.<br><br> Belize citizens also started to pay a lot of money for services that started to take showers of destruction by their houses. This is very important because it shows the most difficult economic situation Belize passed by. Shows the impact of many people and their complicated things they lived.
