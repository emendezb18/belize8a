<p>In an attempt to negotiate an end to the discussion over Belize's territory, the Bases of Understanding were signed by the Prime Minister of Belize, George Price, and the Minister of Foreign of Guatemala, Rafael Castillo Vald√©s, on March 11, 1981, in London.<br><br> In exchange for some rights granted to Guatemala in the area or the Atlantic, the agreement permits Belize's independence (free and permanent navigation to the Atlantic Ocean, construction of oil pipelines, etc.).<br> Nevertheless, notwithstanding the treaty, it took Guatemala until 1991 to permit 100% Belize's independence.This shows how Belize history changed from being colonized by Great Britain to being independent and changed its name.</p>
