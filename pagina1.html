    <p class="letraplaya">Belmopan is the current capital of Belize; a beautiful city filled with rich culture and wildlife. A city going through the mighty Belize River, and ending in the coast of Belmopan. They say in this city the Maya,Yucatec, and the Mopan, migrated while escaping the oppressing German farmers in Guatemala.<br> From 1828 to the start of the 20th century came to Guatemala to explore the different soil and vast nature because in Germany they did not have so much varaity. The germans saw a profit in cultivating high quality coffee and exporting that coffee,So by 1870 the germans ranned the entire economy in guatemala.<br> Although, they used slavery of the native tribes to boost their production. This gave many Mayans a reason to run away from their oppressors, and going to Belize this sparked many legends of lost Mayan treasure to be found near Belmopan.

    <br><br>But if you are not interested in the Mayan history you might be interested in a cruise through the Caribbean. Belize is known to have great beaches, an amazing underwater trench called the Great Blue Hole, settled next to a beautiful light house so you can relax and enjoy your best summer. <br><br>

        <center><h2 class="titulos1">Belize City, The Lost Capital (2)</h2></center><br><br><br><br><br>
        <p class="letraplaya">When the British arrived in Belize in 1862 due to their envy of the success of the Spanish people in colonizing South America, they changed the name of Belize to British Honduras; and made Belize City the capital.<br><br> By then, Belize City was a city invaded by the British authorities serving the crown, a place of organization, a place of order, but everything changed after Since Hurricane Hattie destroyed almost everything, the British tried to rebuild Belize City, which they did, but it would never be the old capital, so the British moved the capital to Belmopan fearing another hurricane disaster. The British lasted another 11 years there until Belize became independent. So if you want to see the ruins of a capital and learn interesting colonial history, I recommend Belize City.<br><br>

            If you don't like colonial history, you might be interested in the Mayan community. Since Belize City is connected to the huge Belize River, it means that the Yucatecans and the Mopan used it as transportation to escape from Guatemala. This caused some Mayans to settle near the river and build many monuments, the most notable being the Lamanai temple, which is believed to be a temple for making sacrifices to their gods. So you can enjoy a vacation full of history of all kinds.
