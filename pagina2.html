        Belize, although it is a country colonized by the British, it is not a country that absorbed the culture of the colonial era. In fact, the opposite was what happened. The British learned the wonders of different types of ingredients such as corn, coffee, many types of lettuce,cabbage, avocado and probably the most widely used fruit in the world, the tomato. This gave Belize an edge in agriculture to make amazing food.<br><br>
        
        Because Belize is connected to Mexico, it's easy to tell they have similar foods and ingredients. For example, you might think that the tortilla is only used in Mexico, but it is used throughout Central America, for example: the pupusa from El Salvador, the chilaquiles, and the rich and beautiful garnaches from Belize.
        Garnachas is a crispy fried corn tortilla topped with a delicious variety of beans, onions and a meat of your choice. I don't know about you, but this explosion of flavor will make you think of living in Belize<br><br>
        
        Now I know you might be thinking that it sounds like it can be a bit heavy, so let me tell you about Garnachas, the lighter sibling, Salbutes. Salbutes are a fried corn tortilla garnished with a variety of fresh cabbage tomatoes and a mix of vegetables. Not only that, but the salbutes can have a meat of your choice added and the icing!
        All of these delicious dishes can make Belize part of a great culinary tour to the Yucatan Peninsula so you can see all the colorful flavors that Central America has to add, and you can have an amazing summer on the beach while enjoying the delicious snacks that Belize has to offer.
